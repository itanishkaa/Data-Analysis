# Data Analysis Project

This repository contains multiple data analysis projects focused on diverse topics. These projects explore data from different domains, including the impact of COVID-19, IPL 2022 performance analysis, Twitter sentiment analysis on the Ukraine vs. Russia conflict, and waiter tipping behavior. Each project consists of Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) for in-depth analysis, accompanied by datasets and other necessary files.

## Project Overview
**1. Covid-19 Impact Analysis**

- **Objective:** Analyze the impact of COVID-19 on different sectors like healthcare, economy, and society.
- **Analysis:** Understand how the pandemic affected various regions and industries. Visualize trends over time to identify key factors that influenced pandemic outcomes.
- **Key Techniques:** Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization (using matplotlib and seaborn), and statistical analysis.

`Covid_19_Impacts_Analysis.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that performs data analysis on the societal and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

`data/`: Contains the datasets used in the analysis.

    `raw_data.csv`: The original, unprocessed data related to COVID-19 impacts.
    `transformed_data.csv`: Cleaned and processed data ready for analysis and visualizations.

**2. IPL 2022 Analysis**

- **Objective:** Analyze IPL 2022 data to derive insights about player and team performances, match statistics, and trends across the season.
- **Analysis:** Identify top-performing players, match outcomes, and key strategies. Analyze player consistency, team strengths, and predict future outcomes.
- **Key Techniques:** Data manipulation, EDA, data visualization, performance metrics analysis.

`Book_ipl22_ver_26.csv`: A dataset containing detailed statistics from the IPL 2022 season, including player stats, match results, and team performance.

`IPL_2022_Analysis.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook for analyzing IPL 2022 data, producing insights on player performances, match trends, and team strategies.

**3. Ukraine vs Russia Sentiment Analysis**

- **Objective:** Perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data to gauge public opinion about the Ukraine vs. Russia conflict.
- **Analysis:** Use NLP techniques to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. Track sentiment trends over time and correlate with key events in the conflict.
- **Key Techniques:** Natural language processing (NLP), sentiment analysis, text preprocessing (using libraries like NLTK and Spacy), and time series analysis.

`Russia_vs_Ukraine_Twitter_Sentimen_Analysis.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that performs sentiment analysis on Twitter data related to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, using NLP techniques to extract insights on public opinion.

`filename.csv`: A dataset containing Twitter data, including tweets, metadata, and sentiment scores.

**4. Waiter Tip Analysis**

- **Objective:** Explore tipping behavior in a restaurant environment to identify patterns and factors influencing tips.
- **Analysis:** Determine how factors like total bill amount, party size, and day of the week affect tip amounts. Provide insights into customer behavior and suggest strategies for increasing tips.
- **Key Techniques:** EDA, correlation analysis, visualization of tipping trends, and multivariate analysis.

`Waiter_tip_analysis.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook analyzing the factors affecting tipping behavior in restaurants, such as the total bill, day of the week, and party size.

`tips.csv`: A dataset containing details about the tips given to waiters, including the total bill, tip amount, and other features like the day of the week.
